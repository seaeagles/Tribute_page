# Tribute_page

This project was created to practice the foundations of HTML and CSS. 
The primary focus on this project is to improve my understanding of CSS variables, flexbox containers, and basic media queries for mobile responsiveness.
The tribute subject was inspired by my own dog who shares many of the greyhound attributes featured on the page.
